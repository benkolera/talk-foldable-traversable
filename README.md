talk-foldable-traversable
=========================

This 5 minute lightning talk was given at the Brisbane Functional
Programming group September 2014.

The idea of it was to briefly explain what foldable and traversable
are and give some motivation to learn the rest and get using it in
your day to day haskell.

The source code is completely runnable. Best way to run it is to
"ghci code.hs" and poke each of the functions through there.

Alternatively, if you want to play with the doctests you can run the
doctests by installing [doctest from hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest) and then running "doctest code.hs".
